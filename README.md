# Neural Nets Demystified

This is code and notes from Welch Labs' [wonderful little tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJwK6jAStmg) here. If you'd like to check out the notes, any `.ipynb` will be more readable than its `.org` counterpart.

I work in Spacemacs, so I wrote the code and notes in Org-Mode, running code using [emacs-jupyter](https://github.com/nnicandro/emacs-jupyter), although tbf I suspect it was basically the same as running org-babel.

Then I [exported to a notebook](https://github.com/jkitchin/ox-ipynb) so that I could view latex on GitHub.

For more advanced usage I'll refer to [Pavel Korytov's brilliant post](https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-05-01-org-python/).
